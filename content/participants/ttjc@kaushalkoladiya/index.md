#### why I like Javascript over other languages

_description_ I like Javscript because the main advantage is, it is a fullstack language. First I learn PHP-Laravel and it has coolest things and features, but laterally I watch a React live session on Youtube which is Tanay Pratap's than i realised PHP was my mistake but now my main focus on React.
